# docking_affinity
This is the directory using ZDock and Prodig. The purpose is to see in the molecular level, which antibody has better affinity on the epitode (in this case Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Such process could block ligand binding, receptor dimerization and subsequently downstream signaling to inhibit cancer cell growth. It could also promote receptor interization and degradation, oeading to receptor down regulation. In addition, some anti-EGFR antibodies can induce antibody dependent cellular cytoxicity and complement dependent cytotoxicity. 

For ZDock, please follow developer's instrution to download:

Tip: to have your pdb files and software storaged in the same directory. Also, do make sure to turn the check to "False" in the subprocess command.
